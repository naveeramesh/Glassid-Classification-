## 📌 Introduction 

Machine learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence, which predicts the values automatically by training the various models with less human interaction. In simple words we can denote that as capability of a machine to replicate a human behavior. Random forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name Random Forest. In the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest results in higher accuracy. The [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification) 

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
  
From USA Forensic Science Service; 6 types of glass; defined in terms of their oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etc)
The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation.
At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence,if it is correctly identified.
 
## ❓ Why Random Forest Classifier?
1.	Random forest algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
2.	It is considered as very accurate and robust model because it uses large number of decision-trees to make predictions.
3.	Random forest classifier can handle the missing values. 
4.	Random forest classifier can be used for feature selection. It means selecting the most important features out of the available features from the training dataset.

Also compared the accuracy of Random Forest Classifier with Desicion Tree, which has very low accuracy.So, RFC is a best suited modelfor this project
